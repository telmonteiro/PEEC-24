# PEEC-24

This repository's aim is to track the work done in the PEEC "The stellar activity in stars with exoplanets".

For now, there is a study comparing the results of $\log R'_{HK}$ for three stars in the paper Pepe et al 2011 (DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201117055) with the values obtained using the ACTIN2 tool (https://github.com/gomesdasilva/ACTIN2). There three Python scripts:

- Average spectra observations available in ESO archive
- Run ACTIN2 on the averaged spectra, plot and save results
- Utilitary script with several useful functions used in the other two scripts
